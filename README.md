# go-games
pingpong.go demonstrates a Table Tennis game and cricket.go demonstrates a one sided cricket game.

Both these uses Goroutines and un buffered channels. These programs are inspired from the talk given by William Kennedy (@goinggodotnet).

Unfortunately these are not in packages so u need to run the programs separately and not from the main package.

<code> go run pingpong.go </code>

<code> go run cricket.go </code>
